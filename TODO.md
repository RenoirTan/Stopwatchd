# Stopwatchd Todo List

 - [x] Add a way for user to start their own `swd` instance instead of a public one. (i.e. `systemctl start --user` should be an option too).
   - [x] `swctl` can communicate with either `sudo swd` or `swd`.
 - [x] Allow `swd` to be configured from a file.
   - [x] Respond to `SIGHUP`.
   - [x] Update config on `SIGHUP`.
 - [x] Refactoring
   - [x] Reduce the number of files under `stopwatchd::communication`.
   - [x] Simplify the API for `swctl::formatted`.
   - [x] Rework naming
     - [x] Use raw `String` for `Name` and (original) `Identifier`.
     - [x] Rename all uses of the name `identifier` and its derivatives to `raw_identifier`
     - [x] Rename `UuidName` to `Identifier`.
     - [x] Make all uuids start with `@xxxx...` right-justified with zeroes to 12 hex chars
     - [x] Ban names that start with `@`.
   - [x] Rewrite `swd::manager`.
     - [x] Each action is a function that implements `Fn(&mut Reply, &RawIdentifier) -> Result<???>` I don't even know anymore.
     - [x] Manager has 3 functions that takes in a callback function to run an action on a stopwatch.
     - [x] `NameRegister` remembers which `UniqueId` is associated to a `Name`.
     - [x] `AccessOrder` is a `Vec` of `UniqueId`, with the last item being the last accessed. Iterating the sequence in the correct order requires reversing the iterator in order to start from the back.
 - [ ] Work on `sw-attach`, maybe with ncurses.
 - [ ] Other init systems:
   - [ ] openrc
   - [ ] ...
